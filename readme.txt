Unofficial Plugin to send WordPress Pages, Posts or Custom Post Types to your bufferapp.com account for scheduled publishing to social networks.

WP to Buffer is a plugin for WordPress that sends updates to your Buffer (bufferapp.com) account  for scheduled publishing to social networks when you publish and/or update WordPress Pages, Posts and/or Custom Post Types.

Plugin settings allow granular control over choosing:
- Sending updates to Buffer for Posts, Pages and/or any Custom Post Types
- Sending updates when any of the above are published, updated or both or neither
- Text format to use when sending an update on publish or update events, with support for tags including site name, Post title, excerpt, categories, date, URL and author

When creating or editing a Page, Post or Custom Post Type, sending the update to Buffer can be overridden for that specific content item.
